At the infamous Cosmic Club in Italy, [Daniele Baldelli](https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/danielebaldelli) pioneered those meandering, chugging grooves that evolved into both the Balearic Beat and the Belgian ‘New Beat’. He’s been at it ever since. ‘Poouli’ a cut off his latest collaboration with [DJ Rocca](https://soundcloud.com/dj-rocca) could easily be a slick slice of moody early 80s new wave music, lost to the ages. Spring had just arrived when we were sent the stems, the air was fresh, with beams of sunlight firing into the studio as the windows were flung open. We wanted to strip the track of its darker edges and to prime it for those rooftop sunset sessions, using the original bassline as a melodic guide, but completely re-working the sound of the track to push it into a longer, dreamier, meditative piece.

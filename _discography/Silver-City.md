Sometimes nice words go a long way. In the Summer of 2015, we sent a Soundcloud message to Kensuke at [Catune](http://www.catune.com/) to say how much we were enjoying their recent releases. He’d just put out [Ichisan’s Mambo](https://www.discogs.com/Ichisan-Mambo/release/7408930) record which is still one of my favourite disco records of recent years – massively underrated I think.

He got back to us saying how much he liked our first release and wondered if we’d like to do a remix of a track off Silver City’s new record, [Projections](https://catune.bandcamp.com/album/silver-city-projections). That record is an abundance of riches but we opted for ‘Do You Want’, stretching the record out adding some additional vocals

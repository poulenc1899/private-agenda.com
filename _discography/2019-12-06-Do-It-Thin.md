Around the time we were gearing up to put out our first single as Private Agenda, Geoff Kirkwood aka (Man Power)[https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/manpower] was already blazing a trail around some of Berlin’s most exciting underground clubs with his wild mix of house and techno, carried off in a sublime yet slightly ridiculous fashion... just as dance music should be really.  His debut full length album on (Correspondant)[https://www.residentadvisor.net/record-label.aspx?id=6259] remains one of our favourite of the last few years, innovative yet fun in equal measure. 

It’s partly for this reason that Geoff is a massive lover of pop music – particularly of the 1980s variety – and took an immediate shining to (Deja Vu, the first record we put out on International Feel)[https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/d7jevq/embark-on-a-balearic-vacation-with-private-agenda39s-debut-release-39dj-vu39-uk-translation], getting in touch to say how much he liked the track and to prospect a collaboration. At the time, Geoff was packing up to relocate to Mexico to start a new life with his wife, so this was another collaboration that came together ‘from a distance’, taking the form of the interchange of scratch demos made on a mobile and lots of emails sent back and forth. In the end, we came up with Do It Thin, a track which unites our collective approaches with its melancholy immediacy and hedonistic intensity with a playful edge. 

Talking of neat fits, this is a combination that Brighton’s (Skint Records)[https://www.skintentertainment.com/] who continue to work with many of our inspirations (like Roisin Murphy and Hercules and Love Affair) thought a perfect addition to their own remarkable record collection.

Over the past few years, [Jim Breese’s](https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/jimbreese) [Balearic compilations](http://balearicrecs.com/) have proven to be an arbiter of taste for all things downtempo, smooth and breezy. He would know what fits the bill or not after all, having been a resident at [Cafe Mambo](https://cafemamboibiza.com/) on the White Isle for many years.

Coming out just before the height of Summer, these compilations are a marker of what you should have in your record bag for all those afternoon sessions you’ve been booked to DJ at.  Having released music on a variety of Balearic labels over the past few years, we’d be lying if we said we weren’t hoping we’d make the grade at some point.

When we were making Dusk & Dawn with [Phil Cooper](https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/phatphilcooper) who runs [NuNorthern Soul](http://www.nunorthernsoul.co.uk/), I think we thought he was joking when he first mentioned the possibility of a [Faze Action](https://soundcloud.com/fazeaction) remix for one of the tracks. They’re a real inspiration for us, so we were delighted they were interested in getting involved with that project. Their remix is a perfect compliment to the original in our opinion, keeping some of the strongest elements and overall feeling, but definitely has ‘their’ stamp all over it. Just what a remix should be really.

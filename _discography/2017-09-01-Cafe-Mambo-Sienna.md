Sienna was the second track of ours to appear on one of [Cafe Mambo’s](https://cafemamboibiza.com/) compilations – a great stamp of legitimacy from a true Ibiza institution – we’re still waiting for the call to play there though. Maybe next year, guys? Another great curation of tracks this, with Sienna resting beside between a collaboration between tour buddies [Parcels’](https://www.parcelsmusic.com/) and [Kraak & Smaak](http://www.kraaksmaak.com/).

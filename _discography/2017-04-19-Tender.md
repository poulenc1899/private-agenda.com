Berlin’s not known to be a disco city. Good disco nights are few and far between. A really good one is [Hot Pony at Sameheads](https://soundcloud.com/hotpony), a fantastic little sweatbox in Neukoelln put on by Timmy Lee and Antoni Maiovvi who also run the label, [Royal Athlete.](https://royalathlete.bandcamp.com/) 

It’s a proper party. An all-out, arms-in-the air, Hi-NRG assault, all sweat and tears. After we’d been living in Berlin a few months and frequenting their parties, we were invited to play. It was our [first DJ gig in Berlin](https://soundcloud.com/hotpony/private-agenda-dj-set-hot-pony-january-2016) and we had a litrle bit of time to prepare, so we ended up making some music for the sole purpose of playing those productions out at the night – Tender was the best of the bunch we made.

Lyrically disarming and full of regret; instrumentally, polished and primal. Pumped with adrenaline and nerves, we arrived early and played it during a soundcheck at the club. Timmy loved it, and snapped it up for his label Royal Athlete there and then. The rest, as they say, is history.

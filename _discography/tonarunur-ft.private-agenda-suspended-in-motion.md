Whilst we are actually still to meet Gauti in person, there was something inevitable about working with Tonarunur – we were drawn through a handful of musical connections, similar to the stage you may have so many mutual friends with someone, you do have to just ask: “how have we never met each other?”

Suspended in Motion was a track that ended up being really quite different to what we originally had in mind. This was an instance where we didn’t just contribute a topline, but instead worked closely on the structure and overall musical direction of the track. Gauti is a master at creating loose, undulating disco tracks and the final result certainly fits that mould.

{: p1}
How would you feel if I wrote a song about us? *Affection* is the soundtrack to those crash-and-burn romances. The backing track to your next hookup, the hold music to the next fuck-up. A synth-pop deluge of sweat and regret. A thematic and musical fusion of romantic pop songwriting and whirlwind dating culture.

Opener, *Instinct* sets the scene, a blockships-thrusting slice of seductive synth-pop. *Ballad of a Bad Boy* then checks the lovers’ pursuit, oozing melancholy. *Change* meanwhile delights in classic pop references with its romantic, intimate immediacy and wistful balladry, before *Bedsheets* draws proceedings to a close, brimming with positivity

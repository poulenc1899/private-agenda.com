[Pete Gooding](https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/petegooding) – an Ibiza institution in his own right who does the programming at [Hostal la Torre](http://www.latorreibiza.com/en/) and had long been a resident at [Cafe Mambo](https://cafemamboibiza.com/) was regularly playing Freefalling from our debut single.

He liked it so much clearly when he was selecting the tracklisting for Cafe Mambo’s annual Sunset compilation (with icons such as Grace Jones also on board) he thought the track would be a compelling opener. I guess this was technically our first major label release as it was distributed by Universal...

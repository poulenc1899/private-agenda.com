If you make electronic music of any kind, you’ll want your music to be played on Tim Sweeney’s [Beats in Space](http://www.beatsinspace.net/). For nearly twenty years it’s been a real arbiter of taste, so we were beaming when Massimiliano Pagliara, a resident at Berlin’s Panorama Bar played ‘Dawn’, a beatless downtempo track from our release with [NuNorther Soul](http://www.nunorthernsoul.co.uk/).

It was bold and beautiful and amazing to hear our music played in that context.  It took us so much by surprise and we were beaming so hard we immediately sent Massi a pretty gushing email. Within a couple of months, Massi got back to us about collaborating on a track for his latest album for [Live at Robert Johnson](http://www.liveatrobertjohnson.com/), the record label run by the team behind Offenbach’s legendary techno club of the same name.

This was an occasion where the timing wasn’t ideal. Sean was in Australia conducting research, whilst Martin was putting some final touches to our first LP, whilst the deadline was short in which to complete the collaboration. We pushed the collab to the top of our list though. Sean sent rough demos off his phone, Martin warmed up his vocals and dusted down the SH10. Massi tidied up the mess we’d made and Jules Etienne or [J.E.E.P](https://www.discogs.com/artist/3558416-JEEP) laid down a slick bassline to polish things off. Turned out to be one of the collaborations we’re most proud of.

{: p1}
Dusk and Dawn is our attempt at a more reserved and refined pop sound. The two tracks came about as the result of a night sat at a grand piano in a basement studio in Berlin in which we composed two nocturnes, attempting to tap into the allure and mystique of the night.  

{: p}
We’d been revisiting some iconic 80s alternative pop albums, such as [Talk Talk’s Spirit of Eden](https://www.discogs.com/Talk-Talk-Spirit-Of-Eden/master/26436) to explore how we might find a balance between an immediate pop sound and a more strung-out, ambient feel. The lead synth-line is a doff of the cap to those inspirations, but the half-time beat and sound design give it a consciously modern touch.  

{: p}
On Dawn meanwhile, we were keen to create a track that just sounded lush and beautiful. Something that you’d be happy to have as your wake-up alarm soundtrack that’d just ease you into the day.  We’d been listening to lots of great ambient music like [Imaginary Softwoods](https://imaginarysoftwoods.bandcamp.com/) and [Croatian Amor](https://croatianamor-alter.bandcamp.com/), and wondered how we might couple the piano recording we’d made with some carefully tooled arpeggios. 

{: p}
The remixes on this record were a real bonanza. [Faze Action](https://soundcloud.com/fazeaction), [Ron Basejam](https://soundcloud.com/ron-basejam) and [Ian Blevins](https://soundcloud.com/ianblevins) all on one record.  They added a real deft touch to 'Dawn', offering something for  all the different corners of the dance floor. It was incredibly inspiring to see (and hear) how many ways quite a sparse, ambient track could be still do some damage on the dancefloor.

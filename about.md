Private Agenda craft lush electronica with a real ear for a hook. They count obscure disco divas, new age ambient concept records and 90s rave anthems among a curious cocktail of influences which reflects their eclectic output  â€“ from their shoulder-pad pop of debut single, Deja Vu to the ambient instrumental EP, Primary Colours, a conceptual record that took natural pigments as inspiration for musical sketches.

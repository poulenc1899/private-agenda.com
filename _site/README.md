This website was built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generation, github actions deployment, [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/) CSS framework and [brutallist design](https://brutalist-web.design/) principles. The site is hooked up to [forestry](https://forestry.io) for easy content management. It's a living document which answers the question "what is Private Agenda".
